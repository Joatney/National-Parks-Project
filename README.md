# National Parks
 Final collaborative project

The Biodiversity folder contains the data files we used to get our data sets.
---
The slideshow_files folder contains files pertinent to making a type of slideshow we did not end up using.
---
The National-Parks document is our mega document containing the original source of all of our code, including all of the things we brainstormed. Some of it went unused in our presentation and report, but we did all of our thinking there. We recognize that it is chaotic, but we do not have to turn in that document.
Do not look to this document to find clean code. It might contain everything, but it will be difficult to parse through or recreate. For clean data, look to the bottom of the National-Parks-Report.
---
The National-Parks-Slides document contains our presentation. It has the RMarkdown file with our slides.
---
The National-Parks-Report document contains our report. That is the culmination of all of our code and the full story we want to share with our data. The bottom of the document contains an Appendix with clean versions of all of our code.
---
Some files in the GitHub are holdovers from tests that did not pan out. The Slideshow file was an unused test for the presentation, which wound up being National-Parks-Slides

The National-Parks-11 16-Viz--John-Oatney file is a sample of visualizations, some used in the final product, and some not. This was used for an earlier assignment, but it is not useful to the final project as a whole.
